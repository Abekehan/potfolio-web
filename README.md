# 💼 Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Framer Motion**.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am passionate about software development and architecture, with interests in design, functionality, and sustainability.  
This website is both an educational project for me and my portfolio. Ironically, it is such both in the architectural field and in the programming field.
